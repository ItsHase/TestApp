          This tag is missing an 'integrity' subresource integrity    
          attribute. The 'integrity' attribute allows for the browser 
          to verify that externally hosted files (for example from a  
          CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. Without 
          this attribute, if an attacker can modify the externally    
          hosted resource, this could lead to XSS and other types of  
          attacks. To prevent this, include the base64-encoded        
          cryptographic hash of the resource (file) you‚Äôre telling the
          browser to fetch in the 'integrity' attribute for all
